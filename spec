==Player Movement==
A class made, that will be inherited by all moving objects.

If the object is moveable and it's not in contact with another solid object beneath it, it will fall.

The player will have a velocity value, that will half if the player changes the direction he faces. It will increase (possibly up to 25% faster at the ceiling limit?)

This will be used to make directional jumps possible.
